## Overview
**atmosbrief** is an automated Twitter bot that provides real-time weather updates for major cities around the world, focusing especially on cities in Africa. It uses the Weather API and the X (formerly Twitter) API to tweet weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, sunrise, sunset times, and more. It runs at scheduled times throughout the day to keep followers informed about the current and forecasted weather.

## Features
- Posts **daily forecasts** for selected cities at sunrise (Nairobi time).
- Shares **current weather updates** for African cities three times a day (7:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 7:00 PM Nairobi time).
- Tweets include detailed weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and chance of rain.
- Uses relevant weather icons and emojis to visually enhance the updates.
- Automatically manages tweet formatting to ensure it fits within Twitter's character limits.

## How It Works
- **Weather API**: Fetches forecasted and current weather information for a set of predefined cities using [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
- **Twitter API (X API)**: Posts the weather updates on the [@atmosbrief](https://twitter.com/atmosbrief) Twitter account using the X API.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the botâ€™s scheduling for posting weather updates at specific times.
- **Time Zone**: The bot operates using the **Africa/Nairobi** time zone for scheduling posts.
